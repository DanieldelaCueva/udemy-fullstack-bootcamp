# udemy-fullstack-bootcamp

A repository containing the files and exercices I made during the Django fullstack bootcamp at Udemy. This bootcamp has been my first real sight at the web dev industry, and has given me the base of backend development. Since then, I have continued developping my backend skills, mostly with Django Rest Framework.
